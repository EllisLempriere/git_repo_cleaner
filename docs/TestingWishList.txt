TESTING CONCERNS
Leave test artifacts/results in place for inspection after test run (use seperate folder)
Don't edit artifact master copies - eliminate the need to reset master copy of repo
Name constants (local repo dir, remote uri)
Abstract out setting up repo
Better test naming
(See deleteTagTest3 for reformatting)
repoEqual -> repoWithSameTagsAndBranches
Make integration tests runable by another user

PROVIDER CONCERNS
Edit provider API to deal with more specific objects (not just business objects)
Take a look at updateRepo
	Should not handle setup
Clarify clone vs setup vs other methods
	Setup goes private, each method gets an explicit statement for which repo it is acting on
GitProvider implementing AutoClosable
Make provider directly handle remote refs
Move retries to be a business layer concern

BUSINESS LOGIC CONCERNS
RepoCleaningInfo naming
(See cleanReposTest1 for reformatting)
Bug where local branch not deleted, but remote branch is - will be solved with refactoring of business logic to only use remote refs

APPLICATION CONCERNS
Make ConfigGetter search for config file instead of providing direct path

OTHER CONCERNS
Packaging for release
Any code that refers to a specific file path needs to be generalized
